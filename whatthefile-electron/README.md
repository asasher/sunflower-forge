# What The File (WIP)

![What The File](./public/icon.png "What The File")

- Completely local so no information is ever sent off of your computer. The tool only uses internet to download updates.
- Give it a folder and it'll create a index of every file in there, links to the originals and makes it available to download as word.
- Completely open-source so you can inspect the code yourself.

(Playing around with a local version of this tool, allowing for integration with local LLMs)
