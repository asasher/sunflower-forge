# 🗂️ What The File

- Only accesses your local files, processes them on your browser, no data is sent to any server.
- Give it a folder and it'll create a index of every file in there, links to the originals and makes it available to download as a Microsoft World document.
- Completely open-source so you can inspect the code yourself.
